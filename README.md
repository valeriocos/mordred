## Projects.json

The projects.json aims at describing the repositories grouped by project that will be shown on the dashboards.

The project file enables the users to list the instances of the software development tools to analyse, such
as local and remote Git repositories, the URLs of GitHub and GitLab issue trackers and the name of Slack channels.
Furthermore, it also allows the users to organize these instances into nested groups, which structure is reflected in
the visualization artifacts (i.e., documents and dashboards). Groups can be useful to represent projects within a single
company, sub-projects within a large project such as Linux and Eclipse, or the organizations within a collaborative project.

1. First level: project names
2. Second level: data sources and metadata
3. Third level: data source URLs

There are some filters and a special section:
* Filter `--filter-no-collection=true`: This filter is used to show old enriched data within the dashboards from
repositories that don't exist anymore in upstream.
* Filter `--filter-raw` and the section `unknown`: The data sources will only collected at the section `unknown`
but this allow to add the same source in different sections to enrich using the filter `--filter-raw`.
* Section `unknown`: If the data source is only under this section it will be enriched as project `main`.
```
{
    "Chaoss": {
        "gerrit": [
            "gerrit.chaoss.org --filter-raw=data.projects:CHAOSS"
        ]
        "git": [
            "https:/github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval",
            "https:/github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sirmordred"
        ],
        "github": [
            "https:/github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval --filter-no-collection=true",
            "https:/github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sirmordred"
        ]
    },
    "GrimoireLab": {
        "gerrit": [
            "gerrit.chaoss.org --filter-raw=data.projects:GrimoireLab"
        ],
        "meta": {
            "title": "GrimoireLab",
            "type": "Dev",
            "program" : "Bitergia",
            "state": "Operating"
        },
    }
    "unknown": {
        "gerrit": [
            "gerrit.chaoss.org"
        ],
        "confluence": [
            "https://wiki.chaoss.org"
        ]
}
```
In the projects.json above:
* The data included in the repo `gerrit.chaoss.org` will be collected entirely since the
repo is listed in the `unknown` section. However only the project `GrimoireLab` will be enriched as declared in the
`GrimoireLab` section.
* In the section `Chaoss` in the data source `github` the repository `grimoirelab-perceval` is not collected for
raw index but it will enriched in the enriched index.
* In the section `GrimoireLab` the metadata will showed in the enriched index as extra fields.
* In the section `unknown` the data source `confluence` will be enriched as the project `main`.

The following sub-sections show how the data sources that is not an URL must be included in the data
sources file in order to be analyzed.

#### gitlab

GitLab issues and merge requests need to be configured in two different sections.

```
{
    "Chaoss": {
        "gitlab:issue": [
            "https://gitlab.com/Molly/first",
            "https://gitlab.com/Molly/second"
        ],
        "gitlab:merge": [
            "https://gitlab.com/Molly/first",
            "https://gitlab.com/Molly/second"
        ],
    }
}
```

If a given GitLab repository is under more than 1 level, all the slashes `/` starting from the second level have to be
replaced by `%2F`. For instance, for a repository with a structure similar to this one
`https://gitlab.com/Molly/lab/first`.

```
{
    "Chaoss": {
        "gitlab:issue": [
            "https://gitlab.com/Molly/lab%2Ffirst"
        ],
        "gitlab:merge": [
            "https://gitlab.com/Molly/lab%2Ffirst"
        ],
    }
}
```


#### mbox

For mbox files, it is needed the name of the mailing list and the path where the mboxes can be found. In the example
below, the name of the mailing list is set to "mirageos-devel".

```
{
    "Chaoss": {
        "mbox": [
            "mirageos-devel /home/bitergia/mbox/mirageos-devel/"
        ]
    }
}
```

#### meetup

For meetup groups it is only needed the identifier of the meetup group.

```
{
    "Chaoss": {
        "meetup": [
        "Alicante-Bitergia-Users-Group",
        "South-East-Bitergia-User-Group"
        ]
    }
}
```


#### nntp

The way to setup netnews is adding the server and the news channel to be monitored. In the example below,
the `news.myproject.org` is the server name.

```
{
    "Chaoss": {
        "nntp": [
            "news.myproject.org mozilla.dev.tech.crypto.checkins",
            "news.myproject.org mozilla.dev.tech.electrolysis",
            "news.myproject.org mozilla.dev.tech.gfx",
            "news.myproject.org mozilla.dev.tech.java"
            ]
    }
}
```

#### slack

The information needed to monitor slack channels is the channel id.

```
{
    "Chaoss": {
        "slack": [
            "A195YQBLL",
            "A495YQBM2"
        ]
    }
}
```

#### supybot

For supybot files, it is needed the name of the IRC channel and the path where the logs can be found. In the example
below, the name of the channel is set to "irc://irc.freenode.net/atomic".

```
{
    "Chaoss": {
        "supybot": [
            "irc://irc.freenode.net/atomic /home/bitergia/irc/percevalbot/logs/ChannelLogger/freenode/#atomic"
        ]
    }
}
```

#### twitter

For twitter it is only needed the name of the hashtag.

```
{
    "Chaoss": {
        "twitter": [
            "bitergia"
        ]
}
```

## Micro Mordred

Micro Mordred is a simplified version of Mordred which omits the use of its scheduler. Thus, Micro Mordred allows to run single Mordred tasks (e.g., raw collection, enrichment) per execution.

Micro Mordred is located in the [/utils](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sirmordred/tree/master/utils/micro.py) folder of this same repository. It can be executed via command line, its parameters are summarized below:
```
--debug: execute Micro Mordred in debug mode

--raw: activate raw task
--arthur: use Arthur to collect the raw data

--enrich: activate enrich task

--identities: activate merge identities task

--panels: activate panels task

--cfg: path of the onfiguration file
--backends: list of cfg sections where the active tasks will be executed
```

Examples of possible executions are shown below:
```
cd .../grimoirelab-sirmordred/utils/
micro.py --raw --enrich --cfg ./setup.cfg --backends git #  execute the Raw and Enrich tasks for the Git cfg section
micro.py --panels # execute the Panels task to load the Sigils panels to Kibiter
``` 

## Getting started

SirModred relies on ElasticSearch, Kibiter and MySQL/MariaDB. The current versions used are:
- ElasticSearch 6.1.0
- Kibiter 6.1.4
- MySQL/MariaDB (5.7.24/10.0)
There are 3 options to get started with SirMordred:

Note that you can omit the `mariadb` section in case you have MySQL/MariaDB already installed in your system.

```
elasticsearch:
  restart: on-failure:5
  image: bitergia/elasticsearch:6.1.0-secured
  command: elasticsearch -Enetwork.bind_host=0.0.0.0 -Ehttp.max_content_length=2000mb

```

### Only docker

Follow the instruction in the GrimoireLab tutorial to have [SirMordred in a container](https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab-tutorial/sirmordred/container.html)


### Setting up a Pycharm dev environment

This section provides details about how to set up a dev environment using PyCharm. The first step consists in forking
the GitHub repos below and cloning them to a target local folder (e.g., `sources`).

- [SirModred](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sirmordred)
- [ELK](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-elk)
- [King Arthur](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-kingarthur)
- [Graal](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-graal)
- [Perceval](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval)
- [Perceval for Mozilla](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval-mozilla)
- [Perceval for OPNFV](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval-opnfv)
- [Perceval for Puppet](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval-puppet)
- [Perceval for FINOS](https://github.com/Bitergia/grimoirelab-perceval-finos)
- [SortingHat](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sortinghat)
- [Sigils](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sigils)
- [Kidash](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-kidash)
- [Toolkit](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-toolkit)
- [Cereslib](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-cereslib)
- [Manuscripts](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-manuscripts)


Each local repo should have two `remotes`: `origin` points to the forked repo, while `upstream` points to the original CHAOSS repo. An example
is provided below.
```
~/sources/perceval$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/valeriocos/perceval (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/valeriocos/perceval (push)
upstream	https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval (fetch)
upstream	https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval (push)
```

In order to add a remote to a Git repository, you can use the following command:
```
~/sources/perceval$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval
```

Then, you can download the [PyCharm community edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=linux), and create a project in the 
grimoirelab-sirmordred directory. PyCharm will automatically create a virtual env, where you should install the dependencies listed in each 
requirements.txt, excluding the ones concerning the grimoirelab components.

To install the dependencies, you can click on `File` -> `Settings` -> `Project` -> `Project Interpreter`, and then the `+` located on the top right corner (see figure below).

![captura_22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6515067/63195511-12299d80-c073-11e9-9774-5f274891720a.png)

Later, you can add the dependencies to the grimoirelab components via `File` -> `Settings` -> `Project` -> `Project Structure`. 
The final results should be something similar to the image below.

![captura_23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6515067/63195579-4b620d80-c073-11e9-888b-3cdb67c04523.png)

Finally, you can use the docker-compose shown at Section [source-code-and-docker](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sirmordred/blob/master/README.md#source-code-and-docker), define a [setup.cfg](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sirmordred/blob/master/utils/setup.cfg) and [projects.json](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sirmordred/blob/master/utils/projects.json), and
run the following commands, which will collect and enrich the data coming from the git and cocom sections and upload the corresponding panels to Kibiter:
```
micro.py --raw --enrich --cfg ./setup.cfg --backends git cocom
micro.py --panels --cfg ./setup.cfg
```

Optionally, you can create a configuration in PyCharm to speed up the executions (`Run` -> `Edit configuration` -> `+`). The final results should be something similar to the image below.

![captura_24](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6515067/63195767-ccb9a000-c073-11e9-805a-e828a3ce1dc9.png)
